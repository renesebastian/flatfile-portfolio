    <p class="lg">Rene.io is the brand associated with the media production company by me, Rene Sebastian. Graduated on video and interaction design in 2007 and started my own company in 2009. At first with a heavy focus on concert photography. Around 2012 it all shifted towards video production for events, since I'd established a network in live events.</p>
    <p class="lg">Now working in the creative industry for over 10 years as videographer, photographer, front-end developer, ux designer and even a podcast producer every now and then, I feel more driven then ever to pursue the not so typical projects. Wether thats in video, photo or whatever it is you're asking. My creative heart just can't handle "that's good enough for now" mentality. If you are looking for a creative partner that looks at things from a different angle, is really driven and is willing to work world wide, then we should <a href="/contact" title="contact">definitly meet</a> for a good cup of coffee. ☕️</p>
